# Uniswap Dex Playgound

This project runs a hardhat EVM chain, deploys ERC20 tokens and uniswap smart contracts, and provides a UI for interacting with them. When a transaction is mined, the data is rendered in the UI so parameters and logs can be read and understood. This is extremely useful for understanding how to interact with a dex, and provides an opportunity to play with scenarios pertaining to slippage, exchange rates, etc.

## To try it out, run the following commands

In the project root:
```shell
npm run node
```

In `/client`:
```shell
npm start
```
